# Recognition-Handwritten-Digits-From-MNIST-Dataset-

• Developed a model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

• Used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to train the model.

• Preprocessed the dataset by normalizing the images and resizing them to a standard size.

• Split the dataset into training and validation sets and used data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

• Implemented early stopping and model checkpointing to prevent overfitting and save the best-performing model.

• Achieved an accuracy of over 99% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in recognizing handwritten digits.

• Showcased expertise in deep learning and computer vision through the project.

• Learned valuable skills in machine learning and excited to continue exploring the possibilities in this field.
